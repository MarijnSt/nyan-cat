## NYAN CAT

####Process

* Create one cat with animation
 	* Add start and endposition in a class
	* Transition property to move from one state to the other
* Randomize one cat (random start position and an end position that's a bit to the right of the start


####Next step

* Spawn multiple cats
* Give each of them:
	* classes for start and end position
	* function that gives them all a unique left and right at different class
* Loop that shit


####Properties to randomize

* left (start and end)
* transform rotate (end)?
* transition (element)?
